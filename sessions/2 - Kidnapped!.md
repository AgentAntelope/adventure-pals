## An Urgent Mission!

As the Pals were setting off to Mizzenmarch, a runner from the Guild came to tell them to speak to Gloria urgently. Unfortunatly some of the Pals had already departed, and so only James, Mulch and Theo could answer the call.

Arriving at Gloria's office, some members of the Expedition Associates were also present. Gloria explained that an urgent warrant had been sent by the Royal Enchanter - on a recent trip through the town, the Enchanter's beloved Colin had gone missing, presumed kidnapped, and there was a hefty reward for his safe return! The warrant note described Colin as having a brown coat and an easily-recognisable star mark on his - ahem - posterior.

Gloria said that whichever of the two groups could return Colin would get a hefty share of the bounty. and pointed them towards the Cantering Colt, an inn on the outskirts of town where Colin was last seen.


## The Cantering Colt

As the Pals got off the Public Transport Carriage outside the inn, they saw the Associates loudly departing the inn, complaining about the 'useless stablehand' and bragging about how they could 'track Colin with their eyes closed anyway'.

The Pals immediately went to talk to the stablehand. After a smll bribe of 10GP, and being reminded helping the Pals would stick it to the rude Associates, he was happy to show them around and answer their questions - namely, was Colin a horse. (Yes, the stablehand confirmed, Colin was a horse.)

Investigating a small gap between a broken board - where the kidnappers presumably got in - James spotted a snagged string of beads, which Theo recognised as a bearing the symbols of Tiamat, the evil dragon god. Looking outside, James was also able to spot a trail of footprints - both small reptilian feet, and horseshoes.

The Pals stopped into the inn briefly to ask around; Theo bought a drink for someone suspicous in the corner, who said simply "we can't speak here", and handed over two Spellshards of Cause Fear.

## The Ruins

The tracks led into the wilderness, towards an old ruined building. As they approached, James climbed a tree to get a better view of the area - only to stumble upon a gang of kobolds! The kobolds got the drop on them - literally - but the ever-prepared Mulch was incapable of being suprised and soon the kobolds were defeated. The last dropped their weapon and surrendered - the Pals gagged and bound the little reptile and brought them along.

The ruin was an old, mostly buried metal building, a type of ruin Mulch had some familiarity with; these types of ruins tend to be very vertical, with many steep drops and unsteady floors over deep pits.

As they entered, they found the Associates bickering in front of a door, and an open panel in the wall. The little kobold looked agitated, and tried to warn them of danger up ahead. Theo checked for traps - when he couldn't find anything, he opened the door using the panel on the wall & told the Associates it was safe. They pushed past and rushed through - only for the small room beyond to crash down a floor, trapping them!

The Pals clambered past the obstacle into the rest of the ruin, but they paused to open a hatch in the Associate's trap room to throw down some celery.

As they proceeded, the kobold again warned them of danger up ahead - with gestures and pointing, the kobold told them of 6 'small ones' in the next room. At Mulch's bright idea, James gently punched her, allowing her to turn briefly invisible in exchange for 1HP of damage. After scouting the room, Theo and James came in, with the now-untied kobold, and tried to parley. The former kobold captive rushed forward, speaking animatedly with the two better-equipped kobolds in the room, and after some discussion one rushed futher into the ruins, and the others quietly slunk away back the way the Pals had come.

Spotting something odd about the floor, Theo stopped to check a loose panel - beneath was an old skeleton, grasping two Spellshards of Frostbind.

## The Store

Exploring the ruin, the Pals came across an odd sight - the floor became more like cobblestones, and the metal walls seemed in the appearance of a storefront, but where the door should be was instead a flat panel. A metal door leaned against a far corner. Theo put the door in place, and found it could be opened!

As the Pals entered, they found a cramped, dimply lit shop, filled with wonderous, mysterious things, many unrecognisable. A small creature, like a pug with bat wings, excitably yapped at them in greeting, and the shopkeeper emerged - heavily robed, with furry, clawed, backwards hands - and Mulch recognised this as the mark of a Rakshasa, a race of beings from another plane of reality.

Theo asked why the shop was in a ruin, to which the shopkeeper pointed out the window to a rainy sidestreet.

The shopkeeper offered James a magical eyepiece, a Monocle of Surreptitious Statistics, in exchange for a favour to be called in later. James negotiated that the favour wouldn't cause their death, or loss of limbs.

Theo was offered a set of Reinforcing Armor +1, in exchange for a secret, which he whispered to the Shopkeeper.

Mulch bought a spellshard of Blood of the Mighty in exchange for one bottle of Srumplowe Applejack.

Shopping done, the Pals donned their new gear and continued on into the ruins.

## Saving Colin

The Pals burst into the final chamber, where a kobold priest was preparing to sacrifice a horse beneath a star symbol like one of Tiamat. The kobolds immediately deserted their ritual to attack, but the Pals stood firm.

Kobolds with slings fired sticky ammunition, coating Theo and trapping him in place, and the priest launched a ball of energy directly into his chest, bringing him close to death! Mulch launched her Flaming Sphere, scorching several kobolds and spooking Colin, who broke free of his bindings and kicked one slinger across the room. James rushed forward and engaged the priest, causually stabbing a kobold who tried to flank them. Theo, finally free of the sticky goop, called down the light of Sehanine and broke their priest's mind with Radiant Delirium.

The last kobold, a slinger with several broken ribs courtesy of Colin, surrendered, and the Pals again bound them to help guide them all out of the ruins safely. They freed the Associates from their trap on the way out, let the kobold go once they were in the wilderness again.

Upon bringing Colin back to Dangham, Gloria was overjoyed, and gave the Pals their fee.

## The Exam

First, the Pals had to answer some questions from Gloria, their boss.

They correctly answered that casting Bigby's Grasping Hands in a confined space can lead to excessive squeezing and RSI.

They identified the Barbarian's Head mushroom, which is used as a stimulant and lubricant, gives a bonus to perception checks if applied to the eyes, and if ingested in sufficient quantities makes everything look very definitely not like hawks. It's also not a cure for cavities, no matter how much you suck on it.

Helga sailed through the questions about Understone Orthodox followers of Moradin, as it's her denomination; during their rituals it is traditional to wear nothing but hammers and moss hats.

And for more recent history, Moonshot told Gloria that his grandfather was the one who stole the Dawn's Light Diamond, and Riteby managed to fraudulently convince her that he himself was the one who repatriated it, and that it taught him to sing.

Then the pals had to show off in the assault course. Unfortuntly, there was a problem with the booking, and the Expedition Associates were also present and did their best to sabotage things. Instead of doing exercise, Theo got some Barbarian's Head from Thorian, who also uses it in 'rituals' of a very different kind and was very judgemental when handing them over. James spent the whole time flirting with Gloria. Glowerfang stole Moonshot's clothing, so Moonshot did some backflips completely naked. Everyone else did some laps and some acrobatics and finished their exercise in good enough time that Gloria quickly moved people on to the traditional Tug-o-War. Warmed up, the Pals had no trouble beating the Associates and tipped them face-forward into the mud, at which point Riteby trampled them a bit and Moonshot stole Gloomfang's pants.

They then performed a brief combat demonstration in which they soundly trounced some training dummies, apart from that bit where one manged to hit Helga in the face.

Gloria handed them a letter from a regular customer, Ser Dimm, and sent them on their way.

## Onwards, to Scrumplowe!

Upon arriving in the small village of Scrumplowe, the Pals headed directly to the tavern, whereupon they tried some of the barkeep's new applejack, which was very good. Mulch bought a couple of bottles. They met Ridley Rumblebough, The Mayor, who invited them to stay in his stables; everyone accepted his offer apart from Chad and James, who stayed in the Tavern.

During the night, Moonshot was was on watch when he was disturbed by a glowing blue ghost, who wandered through the trees and wailed and moaned (not sexily) and told them to leave. Moonshot shrugged, went to bed, and only told the others about this after they'd returned to the tavern for breakfast.

They returned to Ridley's house, where they found him tending the orchard, to look for Ghost Clues, but they couldn't find anything.

They went back to town to introduce thermselves to Ser Dimm, got the keys to the manor, and also chatted to the locals: Paladins of the Raven Queen in a nearby town are offering bounties for Barrow-wights, and there's a mysterious and dangerous Howling Pit they were warned not to go near.

## Into the Manor

There were several skeletons meandering the manor grounds; Chad, James and Moon leapt over the walls for better positions while the others charged through the gate, and working together they dispatched the walking dead swiftly. Inside the manor, they found and appropriated some of Ser Dimm's outfits, and Mulch found a secret dark tunnel in the wine cellar.

Deciding to sneak onwards, they quietly prepared themselves with lights and weapon, and Riteby promptly tipped himself headfirst down some steps, bumping and yelling the whole way; then played a mournful tune at the bottom to confirm his lute was intact, and the others yelled after him to check he was ok.

Rushing onwards, they reached the mausoleum crypt, full of skeletons, and glowing at the back, the Phantom itself. Chad shot it, whereupon it swore and fled. The Pals continued to fight the undead: Mulch summoned a fireball that rolled it's way through the crowds, Helga brought forth her Hammer Guardian that bonked them on the head, Moon caterpaulted himself onto several skeletons swords and nearly died, but Riteby was able to offer him a Healing Word. Theo's armour deflected every blow aimed at him and James twice nimbly dodged between a pair of enemies and stabbed both of them simultaneously.

## Confronting the Villain

Within a few minutes all of the undead were re-dead and they decided to chase after the Phantom. Following an obvious blood trail, and then some less-obvious footprints James claimed to see, they arrived at the house of a little old lady, who corrctly pointed them towards her neighbour, the Mayor's house.

Chad and Moon snuck inside, where they found the Mayor frantically bandaging a wound. Bringing in the others to confront him, Riteby offered to heal the wound in exchange for coming clean - at which point the Mayor angrily confessed to pretending to be the Phantom, in order to scare Ser Dimm away to be able to steal his enchanted orchards. But, he claimed, no-one would believe the Pals if they tried to blame him! They had no proof!

They brought the Mayor to Ser Dimm, who believed the Pals completely, ordered the Mayor put in the stocks, and gave them the fee they asked for - half the usual, 100gp. He also asked if they could help out his cousin when they go back to Dangham. The Pals returned to the crypt and looted 20gp from the skeletons, and then went home to Dangham.

## Back at the Guild

Arriving at the guild for debriefing, Gloria gives the Pals a grade of B+ ("mostly well done, but please don't take people's clothing"), and allows the Pals to keep their entire fee as a reward for a good pass.

## Rewards

* 250 XP!
* plus 25 XP for good characterisation all round!
* 120gp reward!
